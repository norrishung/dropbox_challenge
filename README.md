# dropbox_challenge
Web Developer challenge for Dropbox

##Tools used
All code for this challenge was written in Sublime Text 2. CSS was written using the Sass pre-compiler and with Compass mixins. The final website was tested for cross-browser compatibility using latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE. BrowserStack was used to preview the website in IE. The site is version controlled using git and hosted via GitHub.

##Time Taken
The approximate time taken for this challenge was 6.5 hours.

##In the Future
If I had more time to work on this beyond the requirements, here are a couple of features I would love to work on:
    - Progressive image enhancement for image tags
    - Non-delayed(fast-click) and touch responsive carousel for mobile devices
    - Multiple video sources for IE and Firefox compatibility
    - Redesigned video section so type is more visible on image background
    - Debounced scrolling library to improve performance


Thanks!
